There will be opportunities to play, hack and translate your own data through the BellHouse. What can you make it do? \n",

            "description": "BOOK TCKETS\n\u00a37 Standalone ticket or free to Lost in Music Wristband holder \nCIRCADIAL created and performed by Tanuja Amarasuriya and Timothy X Atack, of Sleepdogs: the sounds of this town\u2019s streets, wildlife, nightlife, vehicles, venues, homes, musicians and offices are looped, sieved, filtered, warped and stretched to make new, beautiful and perturbing music. Circadial is about the rhythms and polyphony of a place; the way that sound can locate you in time and geography. They make local field recordings over the days and night preceding the performances, from which they create a live, improvised constantly shifting music. We think of it as finding the ghost music underneath the traffic noise, street bustle, police helicopters and birdsong. They\u2019ve used these techniques of manipulating field recordings as the basis of composition in a lot of their theatre work, but this is the first project where they\u2019re putting the process at the centre of the performance.\nEach version of Circadial is unique and created specially, and specifically for each location they play. \nGALLOPS are an experimental rock and electronica band from Wales. They have\nsupported the likes of Deerhunter, Battles and 65daysofstatic. \nBEHIND THE SHADOW DROPS the brand new project from MONO composer Takaakira \u2018Taka\u2019 Goto. The project sees Goto combining ambient, trip-hop and other minimalist musical elements \u2013 creating a soundtrack-like, dark musical world for the listener.The live show will consist of Taka solo, performing with various instruments and live visuals. \nhttp://sleepdogs.org/project/circadial/\nhttp://www.behindtheshadowdrops.com/\nhttp://www.behindtheshadowdrops.com/ \nCircadial Credits\nProduced by MAYK. Created for Theaster Gates\u2019 Sanctum, a Bristol 2015 European Green capital Project produced by Situations. Developed with support from Bristol Old Vic Ferment.\n",
